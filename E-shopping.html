                The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop,
                but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service,
                personalize communications, and provide customers choices.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                By 2050, we expect shopping to have changed completely,
                online shopping would be even more popular and different.
                Online stores may not have retail clerks or dressing rooms,
                but they can recommend products based on customersâ€™ interests, style choices, and preferences using data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Advancements in shopping may be used in various ways
                like <b>Smart mirrors</b> to try on different clothing, hats, sunglasses, etc without actually wearing it or try out furniture using measurements of the house.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Possibilities are endless and so is the technology.
