                <h3><b>Neuralink</b></h3>
                <p>Neuralink is a project by Elon Musk to help the people with special needs to be mainly able to communicate and also give humans special abilities. </p>
                <p>For example, controlling things using the brain, A surgery will be required to implant the device in the brain and then the device can be used. By 2050 Elon Musk expects most people will have neuralink implanted in their brains for a variety of purposes. </p>

                <h3><b>Iter - Nuclear Fusion Project</b></h3>
                <p>Iter is a $20 million Nuclear Fusion Project which will be used to obtain energy from very low resources, this is great for the environment and also the costs to obtain the energy will be less.</p>
                <p>35 Countries including India are involved in this project.</p>
                <p>To simply explain, The energy absorbed by the inner walls will come from a fusion powered plasma which will produce huge amounts of power. Even though this theoretical, enthusiasts suggest that by 2050 most airports will use Iter to generate power.</p>

                <h3><b>Biomedical Technology</b></h3>
                <p>Biomedical Technology will advance such an extent that, today's incurable diseases like parkinsons and alziemers will be treated and cured in a matter of weeks to months from the diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Projects like CRISPR will be able to edit genes to cure the dangerous and fatal diseases before birth.</p>
                <p>Xenobots are the 'microrobots' which will live in our bodies and do the repair work, diagnosis, etc.</p>
